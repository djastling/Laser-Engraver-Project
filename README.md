# Laser-Engraver-Project
This project is for BYU-Idaho's ECEN 361 Embedded Systems class for the Winter 2025 semester. 

In this project, we are constructing and programming a Laser Engraver. This device will be able to engrave images onto wood plaques or other materials. These devices are commonly used in industrial settings to create durable text and images on products.
